			<h2>To the girl that caught my eye...</h2>
			<h3>You are an artwork I could admire forever.</h3>
			<h4>You made my mind look like a museum that was once an empty hallway.</h4>
			<h5>These quotes aren't enough to describe how I feel right now. Can't help but just to admire you from afar. That doesn't mean that I won't take risk of having you, I just don't think I have the chance right now.</h5>
			<h6>So I hope one day, the day you knew this was you...
				Sana nasa harapan na kita, nakikita ang magaganda mong ngiti at makikinang na mata...</h6>
			<h7>Dahil aking sinta, ikaw ay isang obra maestra.</h7>
			<h8><p>P.S. I wanna travel Japan while I hold your hand.</p></h8>
