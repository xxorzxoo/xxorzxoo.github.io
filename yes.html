			<h2>To the girl that caught my eye...</h2>
			<h3>You are an artwork I could admire forever.</h3>
			<h4>You made my mind look like a museum that was once an empty hallway.</h4>
			<h5>First, I want to thank you for coming into my life unexpectedly (big thanks to Alon too! <3). I wouldn't be able to know such an amazing person with an angelic face and personality like you...</h5>
			<h6>On the last day of 2023, I formally would like to court you, I may not know the proper way but I would like to do it my way. Just want to remind you that you don't have to feel pressured as I'm not rushing you to make any decisions anytime soon. 
			I am sincere and is willing to get to know you no matter how long it'll take. Gusto kitang ligawan to prove how willing I am na maging part ng life ko at ng life mo. I have no plan on quitting the courtship until you told me to. It'll be my pleasure na ligawan ka araw-araw.</h6>
